Instructions for installing and using our code:
1. Copy all our files into your php directory(There is NO subfolder).
2. Begin the project by installing the necessary tables and insert the relevant data into database using the sql codes.
3. Start your php server and start evaluating.
4. Input your fixed amount of money on the top of the webpage and then invest them in one to four stocks on a given date. You can do this through input values or using the slidebar.
5. After you are done with the investment, hit 'Calculate' and our website will show you a breakdown for your gain/loss.
   
PS:
We limit the date since the dataset only provides stocks information from 1/2/2024 to 9/30/2024. If you use weekends' dates to test our code, it will give you a prompt to choose the valid dates. When you are losing money, the tax in the calculation process will always be 0 since it is not practical to add tax on your loss.
